This is the post that I want to learn K8s from ByteByteGo.

## Preface

- In today's world of complex, web-scale application backends made up of many microservices and components running across clusters of servers.
  We need a tool to manage this. That's where K8s comes in.

## Keywords

- pods, controllers, services
- components make up a K8s cluster
- when and why K8s is useful
- tradeoffs to consider before adopting K8s

## Goals

- a clear understanding of what K8s is
- how it works
- how to put it into practice

## Architecture and Key Components

- client-server archtecture.

1. `control plane`
2. `worker nodes`

CLI --> Control Plane --> Worker Nodes

## Control Plane

- API Server
- Etcd
- Scheduler
- Controller Manager
