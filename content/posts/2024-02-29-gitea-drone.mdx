# Gitea + Drone + docker-compose

## Link

Repo: https://github.com/c1495616js/gitea-drone/tree/main

## Credit to

https://github.com/ruanbekker/drone-gitea-on-docker

## Usage

Set the following in your `boot.sh`:

```
IP_ADDRESS=192.168.0.6       -> DO NOT USE 127.0.0.1 or localhost. either reachable dns or ip address which will be your clone address and ui addresses.
GITEA_ADMIN_USER="giteauser" -> will be the user you register with in drone
```

Now boot the stack:

```
$ sh boot.sh
```

- Head over to: `http://IP_ADDRESS:3000` and click install gitea with existing configuration.

- Register an account in gitea.

- Head over to: `http://IP_ADDRESS:3000/user/settings/applications` and create a new OAuth2 Application and set the Redirect URI to `http://IP_ADDRESS:3001/login`

- Capture the client id and client secret and populate them in the `boot.sh` in `DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_ID` and `DRONE_GITEA_CLIENT_SECRET` and run `bash boot.sh` again. This will give drone the correct credentials in order to authenticate with gitea.

- Now when you head over to `http://IP_ADDRESS:3001/` you will be asked to authorize the application and you should be able to access drone.

## Build your first pipeline

Create a test repo in gitea:

See the `example` folder and Commit a `.drone.yml` file for drone:

```
$ cat .drone.yml
kind: pipeline
type: docker
name: hello-world

trigger:
  branch:
    - master
  event:
    - push

steps:
  - name: say-hello
    image: busybox
    commands:
      - echo hello-world
```

Head over to drone and sync your repositories:
