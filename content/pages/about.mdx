Hey, I'm Jerry Wang, a full-stack developer.

## What's the point of blogging?

- I believe you can learn a lot by following other people's journeys. I'm following a lot of other creators too.
- Through social media and public building, I get to meet interesting people and we can support each other.

## What kind of stuff do you find here?

Blogs, tips, and discussions.
