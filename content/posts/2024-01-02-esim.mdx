This is the post that I want to share the process and gotcha of installing eSim.
I just came back from Taiwan and saw the promotion message that I can have same price but 60G data.

## Spec

- Carrier: Phonebox - Telus
- iPhone XS Max

## Steps

- The carrier will send you the QRCode of eSim in the morning (for me like around 9 am).
- Simply scan it then it supposed to be activated.

## Gotcha

- After I scanned the QRCode, it successfully added to my iPhone.
  However I saw it was not actually activated. Then I thought maybe delete the eSim and then rescan the QRCode.

- This is the keypoint, `QRCode is only being scanned ONE TIME`. Then I cannot added this current QRCode to my phone again.

- Then I reach customer service to get a new QRCode. (And spent additional 10 bucks...)

- After I scanned the new QRCode, it still showing activate failed.
- This is the keypoint, `You need to restart your phone`. Then I saw it successfully connected to the carrier.

## Conclusion

- Be careful: `QRCode is only being scanned ONE TIME`.

- And after scanned QRCode, trying to `restart your phone`.
